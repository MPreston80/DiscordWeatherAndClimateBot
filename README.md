# DiscordWeatherAndClimateBot
The weather and climate Discord bot is online 24/7 hosted on AWS until August 2021 (free tier holla!).  The application uses javascript, node.js, and a few other node packages 
including MySQL, Request, and Cron (for automation of redundant processes). The application records monthly stats regarding forecast accuracy and other interesting data points 
about weather in Flint, MI. Records are kept in a MySQL database.
